# Bakeries

As described in {doc}`../recipe_user_guide/execution`, you can define and execute recipes on your
own computers using the executor of your choice.
However, you can also contribute your recipe to the Pangeo Forge {doc}`recipes`.
and have it executed automatically in the cloud.
Cloud based execution is provided by Bakeries.

# Recipe Contribution

You can do in two ways:

- Open a ticket with a dataset request (no code required!) - Explore other [recipe proposals](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-recipes/issues) and [create your own ticket](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/staged-recipes/issues/new/choose)
- Write a recipe for a dataset you'd like to see transformed - Get started with the {doc}`introduction_tutorial/index`

To contribute a recipe, you will need to understand the basics of [Pangeo Forge Recipes](../recipe_user_guide/index).
The {doc}`../introduction_tutorial/index` is a great place to start, and working through the {doc}`../tutorials/index` can help develop your understanding.

You will also need a thorough understanding of the source dataset you wish to ingest,
and a vision for the desired target dataset (desired format, chunk structure, etc.)
and any cleaning / processing steps needed along the way.
